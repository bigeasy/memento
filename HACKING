Because `etcd` is acutally kind of simple, I'm using it to develop and diagnose
problems with Compassion. Development of Paxos itself is done in unit testing.

Development here is towards an atomic log framework.

Good to use `npm link` to link to...

 * `compassion.channel`
 * `compassion.colleague`
 * `colleague`
 * `conference`

And in `compassion.channel` you should `npm link` to `compassion.colleague`.
